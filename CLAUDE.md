# hr-manager-portal

The Manager portal (leave and budget approvals, team, project codes) of the Nextan Timesheet System. Next.js 16 (App Router, JavaScript), React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, axios. Runs locally on port 3001 (`npm run dev -- -p 3001`). Logged-in user is kept in `sessionStorage` under `hr_portal_user`.

Shared workspace notes, skills and agents live one folder up, in `../CLAUDE.md` and `../.claude/`. If the `nextan-*` skills are not loaded, read them directly from `../.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.

- Before any UI change, follow `nextan-ui-design`. If the same page or component exists in the other portals, follow `nextan-cross-portal` and change every copy.
- This Next.js version has breaking changes. Check `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before using an unfamiliar API.
- Work on your own branch (see the Team table in `../CLAUDE.md`). Never run `vercel --prod`.
- Before reporting a task as done, run `nextan-release-check`.
- All visible text goes through `t("English text")` from `useT()` (`app/i18n/LanguageProvider.js`); the English text is the key. Add the Mandarin to `app/i18n/zh-portal.js` (What's New text goes in `zh-content.js`; both files are identical in the HR, Manager and Account Manager portals, so change every copy). A missing entry shows the English. Dates use `getLocale()`. The language is saved on the account (`users.preferred_language`) and in the browser for the login page.
